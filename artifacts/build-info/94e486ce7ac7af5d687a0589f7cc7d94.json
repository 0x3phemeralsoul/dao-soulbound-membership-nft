Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role.

This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n function call, use {hasRole}:\n ```\n function foo() public {\n     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n {revokeRole} functions.

Token holders can either delegate to a trusted representative who will decide how to make use of\n the votes in governance decisions, or they can delegate to themselves to be their own representative.\n _Available since v4.5._"},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":2436,"linearizedBaseContracts":[2436,920,4978,1865,2494,1981,5002,5014,4214,466],"name":"ERC721Votes","nameLocation":"762:11:9","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"baseFunctions":[1864],"body":{"id":2420,"nodeType":"Block","src":"1121:128:9","statements":[{"expression":{"arguments":[{"id":2406,"name":"from","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":2395,"src":"1152:4:9","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},{"id":2407,"name":"to","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":2397,"src":"1158:2:9","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},{"id":2408,"name":"batchSize","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":2401,"src":"1162:9:9","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}}],"expression":{"argumentTypes":[{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}],"id":2405,"name":"_transferVotingUnits","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":757,"src":"1131:20:9","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_function_internal_nonpayable$_t_address_$_t_address_$_t_uint256_$returns$__$","typeString":"function (address,address,uint256)"}},"id":2409,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"kind":"functionCall","lValueRequested":false,"names":[],"nodeType":"FunctionCall","src":"1131:41:9","tryCall":false,"typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_tuple$__$","typeString":"tuple()"}},"id":2410,"nodeType":"ExpressionStatement","src":"1131:41:9"},{"expression":{"arguments":[{"id":2414,"name":"from","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":2395,"src":"1208:4:9","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},{"id":2415,"name":"to","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":2397,"src":"1214:2:9","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},{"id":2416,"name":"firstTokenId","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":2399,"src":"1218:12:9","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}},{"id":2417,"name":"batchSize","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":2401,"src":"1232:9:9","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}}],"expression":{"argumentTypes":[{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"},{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}],"expression":{"id":2411,"name":"super","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":-25,"src":"1182:5:9","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_type$_t_super$_ERC721Votes_$2436_$","typeString":"type(contract super ERC721Votes)"}},"id":2413,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"lValueRequested":false,"memberName":"_afterTokenTransfer","nodeType":"MemberAccess","referencedDeclaration":1864,"src":"1182:25:9","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_function_internal_nonpayable$_t_address_$_t_address_$_t_uint256_$_t_uint256_$returns$__$","typeString":"function (address,address,uint256,uint256)"}},"id":2418,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"kind":"functionCall","lValueRequested":false,"names":[],"nodeType":"FunctionCall","src":"1182:60:9","tryCall":false,"typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_tuple$__$","typeString":"tuple()"}},"id":2419,"nodeType":"ExpressionStatement","src":"1182:60:9"}]},"documentation":{"id":2393,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"797:159:9","text":" @dev See {ERC721-_afterTokenTransfer}.

module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ``` bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ``` function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role.

In fact, voting units _must_ be delegated in order to count as actual votes, and an account has to delegate those votes to itself if it wishes to participate in decisions and does not have a trusted representative. This contract is often combined with a token contract such that voting units correspond to token units. For an example, see {ERC721Votes}. The full history of delegate votes is tracked on-chain so that governance protocols can consider votes as distributed at a particular block number to protect against flash loans and double voting. The opt-in delegate system makes the cost of this history tracking optional. When using this module the derived contract must implement {_getVotingUnits} (for example, make it return {ERC721-balanceOf}), and can use {_transferVotingUnits} to track a change in the distribution of those units (in the previous example, it would be included in {ERC721-_beforeTokenTransfer}). _Available since v4.5._\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()\":{\"details\":\"Returns the contract's {EIP712} domain separator.\"},\"delegate(address)\":{\"details\":\"Delegates votes from the sender to `delegatee`.\"},\"delegateBySig(address,uint256,uint256,uint8,bytes32,bytes32)\":{\"details\":\"Delegates votes from signer to `delegatee`.\"},\"delegates(address)\":{\"details\":\"Returns the delegate that `account` has chosen.\"},\"getPastTotalSupply(uint256)\":{\"details\":\"Returns the total supply of votes available at the end of a past block (`blockNumber`).
